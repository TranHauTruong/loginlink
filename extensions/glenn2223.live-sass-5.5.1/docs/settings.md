## liveSassCompile.settings.excludeList
>ℹ This setting can vary between workspace folders - [read more][Multi-rootFAQ]

Use an array of various glob patterns to exclude files or entire folders. All matching SASS/SCSS files or matching folders will be ignored.

**Type:** `string[]?`  
**Default**
```json
[ "/**/node_modules/**", "/.vscode/**" ]
```

<details>
<summary>Other examples</summary>

**Negative glob pattern**  
To exclude all files except `file1.scss` & `file2.scss` from the directory `path/subpath`, you can use the expression:

```json
"liveSassCompile.settings.excludeList": [
    "/path/subpath/*[!(file1|file2)].scss"
]
```

**Regex pattern**
Match regex expressions

```json
"liveSassCompile.settings.excludeList": [
    "/path/subpath/[A-Za-z0-9_]+.scss"
]
```

**POSIX brackets - [Full POSIX List]**  
Match alphas, alpha numerics, words and [more][Full POSIX List]

```json
"liveSassCompile.settings.excludeList": [
    "/path/subpath/[:word:]+.scss"
]
```

</details>

---

## liveSassCompile.settings.includeItems
>ℹ This setting can vary between workspace folders - [read more][Multi-rootFAQ]

Process only these specified files. Useful for when you deal with only a few sass files.

**Type:** `string[]?`  
**Default:** `null`

***NOTE:** there is no need to include partial sass files.*

<details>
<summary>Example</summary>

```json
"liveSassCompile.settings.includeItems": [
    "/path/subpath/a.scss",
    "/path/subpath/b.scss",
]
``` 

</details>

---

## liveSassCompile.settings.partialsList
>ℹ This setting can vary between workspace folders - [read more][Multi-rootFAQ]

Using glob patterns, specify what files are actually partials - or what folders contain them

**Type:** `string[]`  
**Default**
```JSON
[ "/**/_*.s[ac]ss" ]
```

---

## liveSassCompile.settings.generateMap
>ℹ This setting can vary between workspace folders - [read more][Multi-rootFAQ]

Create a companion map file for each of the compiled files

**Type:** `boolean`  
**Default:** `true`

---

## liveSassCompile.settings.autoprefix
>ℹ This setting can vary between workspace folders - [read more][Multi-rootFAQ]

Autoprefix unsupported CSS properties (e.g. `transform` will also add `-ms-transform`). Uses [Browserslist] for browser selection

**Type:** `boolean` OR `string[]`  
**Default:** `"defaults"`

- A `string[]` will override the default browsers to add prefixes for
- When `false` Autoprefixer is disabled
- When `true` we will try and search for either:
  - a `.browserlistsrc` file or,
  - `"browserslist": [ string[] ]` in your `package.json` file

    If neither of these are found then Autoprefixer will use `"defaults"`

**Note:** for backwards compatibility with the original extension `null` is permitted. This has the same result as providing `false`

---

## liveSassCompile.settings.showOutputWindowOn
Set the logging level at which errors will be shown in the output window. *There is also a [command](#livesasscommandopenoutputwindow)*.

**Type:** `Trace`, `Debug`, `Information`, `Warning`, `Error` or `None`  
**Default:** `Information`

<details>
<summary> Choosing the right output level </summary>

- `None`: almost no output
  - Running the `liveSass.command.debugInclusion` (`Check file will be included`) command
  - Running the `liveSass.command.debugFileList` (`Get all included files`) command
  - When the `forceBaseDirectory` is not found or invalid (i.e. a file instead of a folder)
- `Error`: this will output when compilation errors  
    All of the above, plus
  - When there is an error or `@error` in your SASS
  - When autoprefixer errors, or is passed an invalid browserslist setting
  - If saving a file to the disk fails
- `Warning`: this will output non-critical issues  
    All of the above, plus
  - Primarily, workspace folder issues
- `Information`: this will output file information  
    All of the above, plus
  - When compilation is starting
  - When files have been generated (it outputs all files)
  - When the watch state is changed
- `Debug`: this will output some info to help with debugging  
    All of the above, plus
  - Details as to why files aren't compiling (not SASS, no active file, etc.)
  - Details of which files are being processed
- `Trace`: this is primarily to aid in resolving problems  
    All of the above, plus
  - A lot of sub-process by sub-process details of progress

</details>

## liveSassCompile.settings.showOutputWindow
>ℹ This setting is deprecated in favour of `showOutputWindowOn`. However, it will likely never be removed

This setting exists for backwards compatibility with the original extension

When `true` the extension will output all `Information` level messages (from above setting). When `false` it will report all `Warning` level messages (from above setting).

**Type:** `boolean?`
**Default:** `null`

---

## liveSassCompile.settings.watchOnLaunch
Defines whether Live Sass should watch immediately over waiting to be started 

**Type:** `boolean`  
**Default:** `false`

---

## liveSassCompile.settings.compileOnWatch
Defines whether Live Sass should compile all files when it starts watching

**Type:** `boolean`  
**Default:** `true`

---

## liveSassCompile.settings.forceBaseDirectory
>ℹ This setting can vary between workspace folders - [read more][Multi-rootFAQ]

Defines a subdirectory to search from. Add a small performance gain by targeting just your SASS folder.

No SASS/SCSS files outside of this folder will be watched/compiled when you save.

**Type:** `string?`  
**Default:** `null`

>**⚠ It is your responsibility to ensure the path exists and is correct.**  
If the path is not found, or is a file, then it will output an error  
If the path is wrong then nothing will be found nor compiled

>**⚠ This setting effects the root path for `includeItems` and `excludeList`**. So, a setting of `/Assets` means that `includeItems` and `excludeList` are both relative to `/Assets` and not `/` (the root of the workspace folder)

---

## liveSassCompile.settings.rootIsWorkspace
>ℹ This setting can vary between workspace folders - [read more][Multi-rootFAQ]

Tells the compiler that a leading slash is relative to the workspace root rather than the drive root.

**Type:** `boolean`  
**Default:** `false`

---

## liveSassCompile.settings.showAnnouncements

Stop announcements each time a new version is installed.

**Type:** `boolean`  
**Default:** `true`

# Notes

## Multi-root workspaces
Settings that can be applied at a workspace level and at root level will have a heading like the one below  
>ℹ This setting can vary between workspace folders - [read more][Multi-rootFAQ]

Not sure what a multi-root workspace is, then [why not read more][multi-root workspaces]?

To summarise; these settings can be applied at the `.code-workspace` level .However, they can be overridden by settings in a `\.vscode\settings.json` file in any workspace root folder.  
For example, if a `.code-workspace` setting is `/src/Sass` but a `settings.json` is `/Assets/Style` then `/Assets/Style` would be used

## Save path notes
The final save path is dependant on three settings: `savePath`, `savePathSegmentKeys` and `savePathReplaceSegmentsWith`. However, `savePath` takes precedence over all three.

- Using `savePath`
  - Starting with `/` or `\` means the path is relative to the workspace root
  - Starting with `~/` or `~\` means that it's relative to the file being processed
- Using `savePathReplacementPairs`
  - Any keys that are found will be directly replaced with its' value. To save false matches, I'd recommend starting and ending with a slash
- Using `savePathSegmentKeys` and `savePathReplaceSegmentsWith` **_(deprecated)_**
  - Any `savePathSegmentKeys` that are found will be replaced with the `savePathReplaceSegmentsWith`. The `savePathSegmentKeys` is an exact folder, this means `"Folder 1/Folder 2"` will not replace anything
